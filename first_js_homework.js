/* 1. The acronym DRY stands for 'don't repeat yourself'. Software developers should pay attention to DRY because this aims at reducing
 the repetition of patterns and code duplication, while also avoiding redundancies. */
/* Differences between const, let, and var: 
    const - When you never want a variable to change.
    var - Available throughout the function in which they're declared.
    let - Variables that are only available inside the block where they're defined.
